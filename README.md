Mold simulation toy project to learn WGPU. Inspiration from Sebastian Lague's excellent video on slime mold simulations [found here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-iSQQgOd1A). 

## how to run

*  `sh build.sh` to compile WGSL shaders into SPIR-V (only needs to be done if shaders were edited since cloning)
*  `cargo run`

## contribute

Obviously this is a toy project, but if you are more experienced with wgpu/rust and see some egregious anti-pattern in my code, I'd love to hear how it can be improved!
